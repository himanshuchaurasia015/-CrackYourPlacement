# Smallest window in a string containing all the characters of another string
# Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 30.19%Submissions: 140K+Points: 8
# Given two strings S and P. Find the smallest window in the string S consisting of all the characters(including duplicates) of the string P.  Return "-1" in case there is no such window present. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index.
# Note : All characters are in Lowercase alphabets. 

# Example 1:

# Input:
# S = "timetopractice"
# P = "toc"
# Output: 
# toprac
# Explanation: "toprac" is the smallest
# substring in which "toc" can be found.
# Example 2:

# Input:
# S = "zoomlazapzo"
# P = "oza"
# Output: 
# apzo
# Explanation: "apzo" is the smallest 
# substring in which "oza" can be found.
# Your Task:
# You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function smallestWindow() which takes two string S and P as input paramters and returns the smallest window in string S having all the characters of the string P. In case there are multiple such windows of same length, return the one with the least starting index. 

# Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|)
# Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n) n = len(p)

 

# Constraints: 
# 1 â‰¤ |S|, |P| â‰¤ 105

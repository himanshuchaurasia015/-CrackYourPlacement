# You are given an array 'arr' containing 'n' non-negative integers.



# Your task is to partition this array into two subsets such that the absolute difference between subset sums is minimum.



# You just need to find the minimum absolute difference considering any valid division of the array elements.



# Note:

# 1. Each array element should belong to exactly one of the subsets.

# 2. Subsets need not always be contiguous.
# For example, for the array : [1, 2, 3], some of the possible divisions are 
#    a) {1,2} and {3}
#    b) {1,3} and {2}.

# 3. Subset-sum is the sum of all the elements in that subset. 
# Example:
# Input: 'n' = 5, 'arr' = [3, 1, 5, 2, 8].

# Ouput: 1

# Explanation: We can partition the given array into {3, 1, 5} and {2, 8}. 
# This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (10 - 9 = 1).
# Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
# Sample Input 1:
# 4
# 1 2 3 4
# Sample Output 1:
# 0
# Explanation for sample input 1:
# We can partition the given array into {2,3} and {1,4}.
# This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (5 - 5 = 0) in this case.
# Sample Input 2:
# 3
# 8 6 5
# Sample Output 2:
# 3
# Explanation for sample input 2:
# We can partition the given array into {8} and {6,5}. 
# This will give us the minimum possible absolute difference i.e. (11 - 8 = 3).
# Expected time complexity:
# The expected time complexity is O(n * ùö∫ 'arr'[i]), where ùö∫ 'arr'[i] denotes the sum of all elements in 'arr'.
# Constraints:
# 1 <= 'n' <= 10^3
# 0 <= 'arr'[i] <= 10^3
# 0 <= ùö∫ 'arr'[i] <= 10^4, 

# where ùö∫ 'arr'[i] denotes the sum of all elements in 'arr'.

# Time Limit: 1sec
